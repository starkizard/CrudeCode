# representing the chess board as columns, diagonal 1, diagonal 2, 
# diagonal 1s value is r+c throughtout, diagonal 2 value is r-c+7 (check it out!)
# Putting queen row by row, so i don't need to check for previous rows, that's why didn't put it
# Putting all the reserved squares in a 2d array
# 
# Used backtracking, putting a queen in row by row, checking coloumn from 0 to 7. the value would be False, if it's not attacked already, and True if it is
# recurse to next row
# if row becomes equal to 8, increment the counter for a valid solution.
